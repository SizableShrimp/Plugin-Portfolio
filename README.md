# Plugin-Portfolio
A portfolio of some of the Minecraft plugins I have made.

Please keep in mind some of these plugins were made when I was very new to Java and others after years of programming with Java.

The newest plugins with the best coding practices and style: WGTitles, Rebirth - made these after taking a break from plugin development to work on a Java Discord bot which improved my coding skills

New-ish plugins: ClearChat, FactionFlight, MinesCommand, Vote Fly

Some older plugins: Prison Backpacks, SecureStaff+

Really old plugin: Staff Online
